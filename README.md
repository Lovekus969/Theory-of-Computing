# Theory of Computing 📘

Welcome to my **Theory of Computing** study repository!  
This repo is dedicated to learning and exploring the core concepts from **automata theory**, **formal languages**, **computability**, and **complexity**.

## 📚 What You Will Learn

This repository will follow standard Theory of Computing topics typically taught in undergraduate computer science:

- 🔹 **Finite Automata (DFA, NFA)**
- 🔹 **Regular Languages & Regular Expressions**
- 🔹 **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**
- 🔹 **Pushdown Automata (PDA)**
- 🔹 **Turing Machines**
- 🔹 **Decidability & Undecidability**
- 🔹 **Complexity Theory (P, NP, etc.)**
