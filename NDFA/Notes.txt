NDFA -- Non- Determinitistic Finite Automata

What is NDFA / NFA?
  NDFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton) is a finite automaton where:
      For the same input symbol, multiple transitions may exist
      ε (epsilon) transitions are allowed (move without reading input)
  Unlike DFA, the machine can be in multiple states at the same time.
