NDFA -- Non- Determinitistic Finite Automata

What is NDFA / NFA?
  NDFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton) is a finite automaton where:
      For the same input symbol, multiple transitions may exist
      ε (epsilon) transitions are allowed (move without reading input)
  Unlike DFA, the machine can be in multiple states at the same time.


Why Convert NFA to DFA?

An NFA can have:
        Multiple transitions for same input
        ε (epsilon) transitions

A DFA must have:
      Exactly one transition for each input symbol from each state
      No ε transitions
