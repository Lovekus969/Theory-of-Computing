What is a Regular Expression?
  A Regular Expression (RE) is a way to describe a Regular Language.
And we already know:
  Regular Expression ⇔ NFA ⇔ DFA
  All three are equivalent in power.
A regular Expression will accept those values. 
| Symbol | Meaning      | Language |
| ------ | ------------ | -------- |
| ε      | Empty string | {ε}      |
| ∅      | Empty set    | {}       |
| a      | Symbol a     | {a}      |
